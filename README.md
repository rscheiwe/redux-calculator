This is a calculator application built with React that uses Redux to handle state and transitions. 

## Getting Started:

1. Fork and clone this repo, CD into the folder in your terminal, and run 'npm install'.

2. After you've downloaded the dependencies, run 'npm start'. The application will launch in the browser on your local server. 

## To Use:

- The calculator does basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

- Use the +/- button to change the sign of the entered number .

- To save a number, type or calculate it onto the screen, press MS, and then select the number you'd like to save it to. 

- To retrieve a number, first select MR and then press the number under which it's saved. You can recall this number at any point during an equation.

- If you've entered a number, choose an operator, and then select an incorrect number, you can clear by pressing C to return to the previous number entered. 

- If only one number is entered after an operation has been selected and the equal sign has been pressed, the calculator will use that original number against itself in the operation. 

### Enjoy calculating!
